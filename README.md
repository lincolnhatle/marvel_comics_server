# marvel_comics_server
Backend for the Marvel Comics catalog web application I am developing. Follows the free API specified by https://developer.marvel.com/.

I want it to be useful for new Marvel fans who are wondering what to start reading, MCU fans who want to understand what the movies are 
based on, or geeks who wish to find information fast so they can win arguments.

I want users to have a favorite issues list/page, a favorite characters list/page, a bookmarked list/page for comics they are reading
or want to read, and a way to leave reviews or notes.
