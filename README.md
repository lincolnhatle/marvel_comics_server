# marvel_comics_server
Backend for the Marvel Comics catalog web application I am developing. Follows the free API specified by https://developer.marvel.com/.

I want it to be useful for new Marvel fans who are wondering what to start reading, MCU fans who want to understand what the movies are based on,
or geeks who wish to find information fast so they can win arguments.
